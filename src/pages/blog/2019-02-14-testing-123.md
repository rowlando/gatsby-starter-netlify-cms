Ok, this editor seems great. **bold** 

![](/img/makers.jpg)

Now I'll do a list in markdown:

* one
* two
* three

New paragraph.

# Heading 1

Some words

## Heading 2

Some more words

### Heading 3.

More words. This is fun!

How do I add an image? I think I have to switch out of markdown mode.

What about code?

```
<html>Hello</html>
```

Ooh, CSS.
